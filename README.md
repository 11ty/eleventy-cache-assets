# eleventy-asset-cache Plugin

Cache remote assets, locally (automatically).

## Features

## Roadmap

* Add support for tiered asset requests, e.g. CSS requests background-images and web fonts, for example.

## Open Questions

* `flat-cache` save method seems to be synchronous, is there a better async one?
* Our cache stores raw buffers internally, which are pretty bloated compared to the original. Surely there is a more efficient way to do this. Maybe store the files in their original format.
